# Herb Buddy
Simple tool to calculate the profit from your last herb run

## How it works
The current GE price of seeds and herbs is pulled from the OSRS wiki, then the run profit is calculated with the following formula

`Profit = (Price of Seed * Number of Patches) - (Price of Herb * Herbs Harvested)`
